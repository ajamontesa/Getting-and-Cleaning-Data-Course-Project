================================================================================
There are two scripts in this project:

create-directories.R in the main folder
initializes the folders Scripts, Data, and Output

run_analysis.R is in the Scripts folder and does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

See CodeBook.md for a description of the variables, the data, and any
transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
